#### 遇到的问题
1. epoll不支持本地文件
> epoll just disallows monitoring of regular files, as it has no mechanism (on linux at least) available to tell 
whether reading/writing a regular file would block

[Why does select.select() work with disk files but not epoll()?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8645721/why-does-select-select-work-with-disk-files-but-not-epoll)

每次执行，都会提示操作不被允许 `PermissionError: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted`,最后使用了`select`模块。
